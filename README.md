# INTRODUCTIONS
Hi everyone my name is Akinsola Adefolahan and I am the author of this repo. I realize that many people value their time and i wouldn't want to waste that so i will be straight to the point. The plug is a service that provides you with the ablity to host your neural networks without the need of setting up a server, and providing you an personalized API endpoint to which you can make request. All of this process has been designed to take you 10 minutes at most.

## SUPPORT
- At the moment the API end points are able to handle images, list of values or integers **POSTED** to the end points. Code snippets for integration into your webapps will be made available in this repo as well.
